I have broad and flexible teaching interests. My interdisciplinary background on Management Information Systems (MIS), mathematics, statistics, and computer science allows me to teach a wide range of courses, including both technical and managerial courses. These include but not limited to business analytics, statistics for quantitative analysis, statistical machine learning, deep learning, text/data/web mining, programming and web crawling, database, and operations management. Last, given my training in various disciplines, I believe I can handle relevant new courses whenever necessary.
