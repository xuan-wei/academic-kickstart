This is Teaching Course Evaluation (TCE) for the class MIS 373 Basic Operations Management. Find the slides [here](/files/TCE.pdf).

I got some very nice feedbacks from the students. Here is a sample list:

- *I like how engaged in the material Xuan was. He did his best every lecture to find examples for us to relate the material to every day life.He gave us contact feedback and made sure we all understood the material before moving on to the next topic. There needs to be more professors like Xuan.*
