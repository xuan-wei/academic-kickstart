This is a sample lesson plan for the class MIS 507 Software Design and Integration wher I am a guest lecturer. In this class, we try to understand the motivation and the conceptual ideas behind the strategy pattern. Student will know how to use UML to represent a strategy pattern-based design and how to implement a strategy pattern. Find the lesson plan [here](/files/sample_lesson_plan.pdf).
